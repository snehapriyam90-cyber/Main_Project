Organic Fruits and Vegetables Selling Web App
Project Overview

The Organic Fruits and Vegetables Selling Web App is a web-based platform developed to help farmers sell organic fruits and vegetables directly to customers. The main aim of this project is to provide fresh and chemical-free food to consumers while supporting local farmers by eliminating intermediaries. The system offers a simple, secure, and user-friendly environment for both buying and selling organic products online.

Purpose of the System

This application is designed to promote healthy living by encouraging the use of organic food. It creates a direct connection between farmers and customers, ensuring fair pricing for farmers and fresh produce for customers. The platform also simplifies product management, order handling, and payment processing through an integrated system.

System Architecture

The project is divided into multiple applications to maintain modularity and scalability. The main applications included in this system are the Admin App, Farmer App, Customer App, Products App, Cart App, and Payment App. Each app is responsible for handling specific functionalities within the system.

Admin App

The Admin App allows the administrator to manage the entire platform. The admin is responsible for managing farmers, customers, and products available on the system. The admin can approve or reject farmer registrations, view and update all customer orders, monitor sales reports and system activity, and edit or remove inappropriate products or customer reviews.

Farmer App

The Farmer App enables farmers to manage their products and orders efficiently. Farmers can add, edit, and delete fruits and vegetables, update prices, stock levels, and availability, and view customer orders related to their products. They can also update order statuses and manage their personal profile and farm-related information.

Customer App

The Customer App provides an easy and convenient shopping experience. Customers can register, log in, and update their profiles. They can browse all available fruits and vegetables, add products to the cart, and place orders. Customers can also view their order history, track order status, write reviews, give ratings for purchased products, and manage shipping addresses and payment preferences.

Products App

The Products App is responsible for storing and managing all product-related information. It maintains details such as product name, category, price, and stock quantity. Products are organized into categories like fruits and vegetables. The app supports full CRUD operations and allows customers to search and filter products by name or category. Product pages also display customer ratings and reviews.

Cart App

The Cart App manages customer cart operations and order placement. Customers can add, remove, and update items in their cart before placing an order. The app generates order summaries and allows customers to choose between cash on delivery and online payment options. Order tracking is supported, and both farmers and admins can update the order progress.

Payment App

The Payment App handles secure payment processing for online transactions. It integrates a payment gateway to ensure safe payments. The system records successful and failed transactions and automatically updates the payment status in the order. Customers receive confirmation messages after successful payment and order placement.

Conclusion

The Organic Fruits and Vegetables Selling Web App provides a reliable and efficient solution for purchasing organic food online. It benefits customers by offering fresh and safe produce while empowering farmers with a direct digital marketplace. Overall, the system simplifies the buying and selling process and promotes sustainable and healthy food practices.
