        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Kisan Fresh</strong>. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we take great care in
            sourcing, packing, and delivering fresh fruits and vegetables. We understand that certain situations
            may require order cancellation or resolution, and this policy outlines the process clearly.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Order Cancellation Policy</h4>
        <p>
            Customers may request order cancellation before the order is shipped or within three hours of placing
            the order, whichever occurs first. Once an order is confirmed, partial cancellations or removal of
            specific items are not permitted. To request cancellation, please contact us via phone or email.
        </p>

        <p>
            For prepaid orders cancelled within the allowed time frame, a full refund will be initiated after
            verification. Approved refunds are generally processed within 24 to 48 business hours. Kisan Fresh
            reserves the right to refuse cancellation or delay refunds in cases of repeated bulk cancellations
            or misuse of services.
        </p>

        <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the perishable nature of fruits and vegetables, refunds are not applicable once the order
            has been delivered. However, in exceptional cases where a refund is approved, the amount will be
            processed within five working days through the original payment method.
        </p>

        <h4>Damaged or Spoiled Products</h4>
        <p>
            If you receive products that are damaged, spoiled, or unfit for consumption, please notify us within
            24 hours of delivery along with clear photo or video proof of unboxing. After evaluation, we may
            arrange a replacement or provide store credit based on the situation.
        </p>

        <h4>Incorrect or Missing Items</h4>
        <p>
            In case of incorrect or missing items in your order, please inform us within 24 hours of delivery.
            Our support team will verify the issue and arrange appropriate resolution such as replacement or
            store credit. Providing unboxing images or videos will help us resolve the issue faster.
        </p>

        <h4>No Returns Policy</h4>
        <p>
            Kisan Fresh does not accept returns for opened, used, or partially consumed products due to hygiene
            and food safety concerns. Once delivered, products cannot be returned under normal circumstances.
        </p>

        <h4>Shipping Charges</h4>
        <p>
            For orders below ₹300, a shipping fee of ₹50 is applicable. Cash on Delivery (COD) orders incur an
            additional charge of ₹50. Shipping charges are non-refundable once the order is dispatched.
        </p>

        <h4>Delivery Timeline</h4>
        <p>
            After order processing, our delivery partners such as DTDC, India Post, or Delhivery will collect
            your order from our warehouse. Delivery usually takes between 3 to 7 working days depending on
            your location.
        </p>

        <h4>Additional Information</h4>
        <p>
            Kisan Fresh is not responsible for any damage caused after delivery. Compensation in monetary form
            is generally not provided. Any approved refunds or credits are processed strictly as per our policy.
        </p>
